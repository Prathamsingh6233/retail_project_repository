Retail Sales Analysis

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a retail sales dataset to gain valuable insights that can help retail shop owners improve their sales performance.
By leveraging data analysis techniques and visualization tools, we can identify trends, patterns, and opportunities to optimize inventory management,
marketing strategies, and overall business operations.

Data and Methodology
Data Acquisition:
Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
Data cleaning and normalization were performed using Microsoft Excel.
Data Analysis:
SQL Queries: PostgreSQL was used to execute SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset.
Data Visualization: Power BI was employed to create interactive visualizations to explore the data and uncover insights.
Key Findings and Insights

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be considered:
Inventory Management:
Optimize inventory levels to avoid stockouts and overstocking.
Implement a robust inventory management system to track stock levels and reorder points.

Targeted Marketing:
Utilize customer segmentation to tailor marketing campaigns and promotions to specific customer groups.
Leverage digital marketing channels to reach a wider audience.

Explore opportunities for expansion or partnerships in high-potential regions.

Category Optimization:
Prioritize stocking and promoting high-demand categories.
Consider discontinuing or reducing inventory for slow-moving categories.

Further Exploration

To delve deeper into the data and uncover additional insights, future analysis could focus on:

1) Time Series Analysis: Forecasting future sales trends and identifying seasonal patterns.
2) Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis: Identifying high-value customers and implementing loyalty programs.
3) Price Elasticity Analysis: Assessing the impact of price changes on sales.
